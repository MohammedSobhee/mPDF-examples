# mPDF-examples

[mPDF](http://www.mpdf1.com) is a Free Software PHP class originally written by Ian Back, which generates PDF files from UTF-8 encoded HTML. It is based on FPDF and HTML2FPDF, with a number of enhancements.

The [mPDF](https://github.com/mpdf/mpdf) source contains a bunch of examples. These additional examples can be used for testing book production from web sources.
