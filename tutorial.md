## Why use PDF, when HTML is so much easier?

* PDF connects you to the global publishing supply chain
* It offers precise control over layouts
* A vector format means crisp fonts and graphics
* ~~It is a secure format and cannot be modified~~

* Specialised for making books
* Support for a very wide range of languages
* Bundled with global language fonts to work out of the box
